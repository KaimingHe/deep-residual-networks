### Introduction

This repository contains the original models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152) described in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). These models are those used in [ILSVRC] (http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/) and [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015) 2015 competitions, which won the 1st places in: ImageNet classification, ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

**Note**

0. Re-implementations with **training code** and models from Facebook AI Research (FAIR): [blog](http://torch.ch/blog/2016/02/04/resnets.html), [code](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch)
0. Code of improved **1K-layer ResNets** with 4.62% test error on CIFAR-10 in our new arXiv paper: https://github.com/KaimingHe/resnet-1k-layers

### Disclaimer and known issues

0. These models are converted from our own implementation to a recent version of Caffe (2016/2/3, b590f1d). The numerical results using this code are as in the tables below.
0. These models are for the usage of testing or fine-tuning.
0. These models were **not** trained using this version of Caffe.
0. If you want to train these models using this version of Caffe without modifications, please notice that:
	- GPU memory might be insufficient for extremely deep models.
	- Changes of mini-batch size should impact accuracy (we use a mini-batch of 256 images on 8 GPUs, that is, 32 images per GPU).
	- Implementation of data augmentation might be different (see our paper about the data augmentation we used).
	- We randomly shuffle data at the beginning of every epoch.
	- There might be some other untested issues.
0. In our BN layers, the provided mean and variance are strictly computed using average (**not** moving average) on a sufficiently large training batch after the training procedure. The numerical results are very stable (variation of val error < 0.1%). Using moving average might lead to different results. 
0. In the BN paper, the BN layer learns gamma/beta. To implement BN in this version of Caffe, we use its provided "batch_norm_layer" (which has no gamma/beta learned) followed by "scale_layer" (which learns gamma/beta).
0. We use Caffe's implementation of SGD with momentum: v := momentum\*v + lr\*g. **If you want to port these models to other libraries (e.g., Torch, CNTK), please pay careful attention to the possibly different implementation of SGD with momentum**: v := momentum\*v + (1-momentum)\*lr\*g, which changes the effective learning rates.
